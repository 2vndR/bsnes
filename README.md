bsnes
=====

bsnes is a multi-platform Super Nintendo (Super Famicom) emulator that focuses
on performance, features, and ease of use.

bsnes currently enjoys 100% known, bug-free compatibility with the entire SNES
library when configured to its most accurate settings.

Development
-----------

Git is used for the development of new releases, and represents a staging
environment. As bsnes is rather mature, things should generally be quite stable.
However, bugs will exist, regressions will occur, so proceed at your own risk.

If stability is required, please download the latest stable release from the
